## Hazelcast Jet

[Hazelcast Jet](http://jet.hazelcast.org) is a distributed computing platform built for high-performance stream processing and fast batch processing. It embeds Hazelcast In Memory Data Grid (IMDG) to provide a lightweight package of a supplier and a scalable in-memory storage.

Visit [jet.hazelcast.org](http://jet.hazelcast.org) to learn more about the architecture and use-cases.

### Features:

* Low latency and distributed general data processing framework with high throughput.
* Highly parallel and distributed stream and batch processing of data.
* Distributed java.util.stream API support for Hazelcast data structures such as IMap and IList.
* Connectors allowing high-velocity ingestion of data from Apache Kafka, HDFS, Hazelcast IMDG, sockets and local data files (such as logs or CSVs)
* API for custom connectors
* Distributed implementations of java.util.{Queue, Set, List, Map} data structures highly optimized to be used for the processing
* Dynamic node discovery for both on-premise and cloud deployments.
* Virtualization support and resource management via Docker, YARN and Mesos
